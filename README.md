# UKLAD

UKLAD (UKrainian-LAtin Duality, UKrajinśko-LAtynśka Dvojednisť) is a project aiming at introducing latinized alphabet to Ukrainian language while preserving the cyrillic form of writing.
See the example in ```examples/```, and the transliterator along with the keyboard in ```src/```.

You can also try the transliterator live [here](https://maxt86.github.io/UKLAD/src/trans/index.html).
